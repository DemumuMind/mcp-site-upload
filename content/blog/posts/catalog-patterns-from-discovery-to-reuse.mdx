## Capture the context, not only the link

A useful catalog entry includes setup constraints, auth mode, known limits, and support status.

Context-rich entries reduce repeated discovery work across squads.

## Standardize the handoff format

Define a compact template for discovery notes and rollout readiness.

This makes handoff predictable and keeps implementation teams aligned with product intent.

- What was tested and by whom
- Known failure modes
- Fallback and rollback notes
