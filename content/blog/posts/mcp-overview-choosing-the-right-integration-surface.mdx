## Integration surface is a long-term decision

Choosing a server only by feature list causes hidden costs later in maintenance and incident response.

The better decision model starts with lifecycle ownership, compliance limits, and error visibility.

## Score candidates with architectural criteria

Use a weighted matrix instead of subjective selection.

Even lightweight scoring reveals which option is operationally safe and which is only fast in demos.

- Authentication and secret boundaries
- Rate-limit behavior and retries
- Operational ownership and on-call model
