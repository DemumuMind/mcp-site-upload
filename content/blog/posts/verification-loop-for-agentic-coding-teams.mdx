## Planning is necessary but insufficient

Multi-agent delivery fails when the plan is not continuously validated against implementation reality.

A formal verification loop keeps architecture, code, and quality gates synchronized.

## Use explicit checkpoints

Between planning iterations, run targeted checks that either confirm assumptions or force immediate correction.

- Design consistency check
- Lint/build baseline check
- User-path smoke check
